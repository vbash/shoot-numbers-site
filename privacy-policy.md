# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: September 16, 2025**

This Privacy Policy describes how Shoot Numbers ("we", "our", or "us") handles information in our mobile application.

## Information We Collect

**We do not collect any personal information.** Shoot Numbers is designed with privacy in mind and operates entirely on your device.

### Local Data Storage

The app stores the following information locally on your device only:

- **Training Preferences**: Your configured timing settings, number of targets, and step ranges
- **App Settings**: Language selection, audio preferences, and voice settings
- **Session Configuration**: Your customized training parameters

This data is stored using iOS's standard UserDefaults system and never leaves your device.

## Text-to-Speech Functionality

Shoot Numbers uses your device's built-in text-to-speech system to announce numbers during training sessions. This processing:

- Occurs entirely on your device
- Does not transmit any audio data
- Does not record or store voice information
- Uses only Apple's native iOS speech synthesis

## Data Sharing

We do not share any data because we do not collect any data. Your training preferences and app settings remain private and local to your device.

## Third-Party Services

Shoot Numbers does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services.

## Children's Privacy

Our app does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13 years of age.

## Data Security

Since all data remains on your device, the security of your information depends on your device's security settings. We recommend:

- Keeping your iOS device updated
- Using device passcode/biometric protection
- Following Apple's security best practices

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date.
